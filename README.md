# Ex4_Mario
The game is a 3-level game.
In the first level, Mario should get to the end of the map using a special skill that he needs to pick from a surprise. After taking that gift, Mario will be able to jump very high for 10 seconds, so he will be able to reach the coin located at a high tower.
In the second level, Mario will need to get to the end of the map while looking out for his enemies. The enemies shouldn't touch Mario. Mario can beat the enemy by jumping on his head.
In the last part, Mario will need to deal with a strong wind at some point of the level. This wind will make it difficult for him to move and avoid being caught by the enemy.
At every level, there is a pole at the end of the map. By touching it, you will go over to the next level.
